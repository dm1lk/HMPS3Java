## What is the HMP?
The HMP is a semi-hardcore multiplayer server where if you die, you become a ghost.

**HOWEVER**, death is reversible, utilising the power of the four artifacts and the powerful revive book, you can bring anyone back to life!

*Apart from that it's just a normal lore-based SMP lmao. Oh yeah there's also a public variant of it too.*

# Features
The main feature-set includes:
- Handles Revival (Obviously)
- Handles Animations
- Handles Permissions
- Handles Messages
- Handles Quest Rewards (HMPublic)

*This is not an exhaustive list and does not cover every feature, so please look at the code and see for yourself.*
